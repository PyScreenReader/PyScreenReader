VirtualGroupWidget
==================
.. class:: VirtualGroupWidget

   A VirtualGroupWidget represents a container-like native widget
   that groups other widgets together in the accessibility tree.
   Examples include rows, columns, lists, or generic grouping elements.

   This abstraction models the hierarchical structure of the widget tree.
   A VirtualGroupWidget typically does not handle direct user interactions itself.
   If the native widget has specific interactive behaviors or functionalities,
   it should generally not be mapped to a VirtualGroupWidget.
